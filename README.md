This repository contain Face detection models i.e  YuNet and Haarcascade. The detected faces are extracted from the input images and saved into the respective folders i.e. Haarcascade faces and YuNet faces.
Which shows that the the YuNet face detector is capable of detecting more faces as compared Haarcascade model for a given input image (largest selfie image). Moreover the YuNet model is also 
efficient in terms of time consumption in contrast to the Haarcascade. 

For input image with resolution (2048 x 1150) YuNet model detect 273 faces in 0.423 seconds, where as Haarcascade is capable of detecting 90 faces in 1.5 seconds. 

Refer to the output images of both models:
1.  largest selfie (YuNet).jpg            ------ detected faces with facial landmarks 
2.  largest selfie (Haarcascade).jpg      ------ detected faces
